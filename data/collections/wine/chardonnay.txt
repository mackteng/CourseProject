A deeply golden and saturated Chardonnay wine that sees both steel and barrique but seems to have lost its freshness along the way. There is toasted almond, melon and vanilla but the mouthfeel is a bit heavy.
A seemingly sweet, simple but likeable Chardonnay, this shows the buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors so popular among consumers, with rich pineapple and mango notes and a nice burst of Carneros acidity.
Lots of smoky oak frames modest flavors of pineapples in this creamy wine. Production was 6,300 cases.
Like so many Drouhin wines, this is beautifully balanced. The wood, green fruit, spice and acidity already in fine harmony. There is a richness coming from the deep soils of the vineyard. Can it age? Probably, because of the firm structure.
Yeasty, almost tasting like beer, this Chardonnay may need a bit more bottle age to show its best. A peppery, herbal element surfaces, with a crisp green-apple flavor.
Baked apple and pear laced in caramel come to mind first, evoked from the aromatics of this wine. A richness of honey beckons, too. Golden in color and creamy in texture, it's balanced by streamlined acidity that keeps it elegant and refined, moving slowly toward a lengthy, drawn-out finish.
Kind of earthy and mute, and also soft, with the flavor of canned fruit syrup, although it's fairly dry.
