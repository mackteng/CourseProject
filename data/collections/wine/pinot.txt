Young and tart, this acid-driven Pinot Noir shows more herb than fruit, but it drinks well. The cranberry and wild strawberry flavors are offset with fresh herbs, rosemary and pine needles. Sharp and aggressive.
An attractive yet fresh sparkling Pinot Noir ros√©. It has a fine balance with its acidity well integrated into the raspberry fruit flavors. There's just an edge of bitterness that spoils the aftertaste.
Feels heavy and jammy in the mouth, with raspberry and cherry flavors that are generously oaked. That barrel aging regime brings butterscotch and sweet vanilla to the mix. The result is a rather soft, sweet Pinot Noir whose richness outweighs its complexity.
This is a sturdy, stemmy, sharp and chewy bottle. It has some bitter, tarry flavors, but might be up to the challenge of spicy foods or stewed meats.
Here is a gentle, evocative Pinot Noir, with a pretty, almost delicate mix of flavors. Raspberry, black cherry, dried leaves and black olive swirl together, with a lick of chocolate in the finish.
